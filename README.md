Why SparkyLinux Small Business?
SparkyLinux is a GNU/Linux distribution created on the top of Debian GNU/Linux operating system.

SparkyLinux is fast, lightweight and fully customizable OS, it supports about 20 desktop environments and window managers giving you freedom of choice, having in mind that your computer is made for working, having fun, entertainment, keeping in touch with friends, and many, many other things.

Having that clear statement in mind, SparkyLinux developed an equally easy to use complete solution for small business that are growing, but do not yet have money or interest into investing into expensive licence to have an domain based file server and accounts, so all the data is centered at one more robust computer and therefor can make use of smaller factor clients computers/devices to access user accounts and files.

SparkyLinux Small Business “Server” is the best choice to migrate from your existing old windows server or starting a new one. Try a GNU/Linux distribution without need of worries about licences and hardware investments.

SparkyLinux Small Business “Client” is targeted to the machines/devices that will make use of accounts and shares on the installed server version.
